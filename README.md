## Customized Face
Your own parameter! Create a new attribute of your choice that maps to a procedural face characteristic in the domain of [0,1]. It SHOULD NOT be a literal attribute, eg. eye-separation or mouth size, but instead a more qualitative, subjective quality that you tie to specific geometic parameters using your design sense. Have fun!
